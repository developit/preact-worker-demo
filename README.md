Have you ever wondered if you could take advantage of Web Workers to render a Virtual DOM app in a background thread? This repo contains the source code of a [demo messaging app](https://preact-worker-demo.surge.sh) that does just that! 🌈

> ⚡️ A complete [Preact] app running _entirely_ within a Web Worker.

> 💁 For a high level overview of the approach, see [How It Works](#how-it-works).

# How It Works

The implementation is split into [renderer/dom.js](https://github.com/developit/preact-worker-demo/blob/master/src/renderer/dom.mjs) and [renderer/worker.js](https://github.com/developit/preact-worker-demo/blob/master/src/renderer/worker.mjs).  These modules live outside and inside the Worker (respectively), and communicate with eachother asynchronously via `postMessage()`.

The app's code, components, libraries and DOM are all isolated in a single Worker (background thread).  This means even [Preact]'s diff algorithm and component instantiation is done in the worker.  The main (UI) thread simply applies a stream of serialized DOM change descriptions ([MutationRecords]), and proxies events back to the Worker to be handled off the main thread.

As an optimization, when serializing DOM Elements to be published up to the UI thread, any previously-sent Elements are replaced with IDs. These are correlated through a mapping retained on both sides of the thread boundary.
